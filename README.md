# giffygram

### App Revolution sweeping the Nashville Software School Cohort 47.
Using JSON database to store users and their post entries of gifs

#### Uses
1. JSON Server to serve from **api** folder json-server -p 8088 -w giffygram.json
1. Serve html from **src** folder
#### Teaches: 
1. Single Responsibility Principle- Modularity
1. GET, POST, fetch 
1. JSON-Server
1. JSON response, parsing and stringify
1. Import, Export of Javascript
1. Reusability of functions
1. Event handlers
1. Filtering data using Javascript Array Methods
1. Debugging
1. Testing as functionality is developed
1. DOM insertion and manipulation
1. Other stuff I am not remembering at this time
